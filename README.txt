This code is based on glut because I didn't want to do the assignment in Unity and didn't know much about realtime graphics :P
This means it only compiles on win32. 

If you really want to compile and run this code, here's the original readme for the assignment :

Hover over a cell and press :

1 to change it to grass
2 to change it to a mountain (double the cost)
3 to change it to impassable terrain
4 to place a star on the cell
5 to place the trader on the cell
6 to place the spaceship on the cell
